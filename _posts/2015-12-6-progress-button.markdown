I was recently inspired by Apple's progress buttons in the app store, so I decided to create my own to use within Guidebook. This is a screen recording of the actual button running in the app (not a prototype).

<div class="img img-has-border">
    <div class="img_image">
        <img src="https://d13yacurqjgara.cloudfront.net/users/108740/screenshots/2388579/loading-button.gif" />
    </div>
    <p class="img_caption">Guidebook's new app store style progress button.</p>
</div>
