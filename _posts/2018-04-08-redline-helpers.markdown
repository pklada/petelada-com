If you still have to redline specs (like I do on occasion) and don't want to use Sketch Measure, and still haven't transitioned to Figma for some reason, you may find this collection of symbols I created helpful. The symbols are a set of redline helpers -- both width/height measurement as well as area measurement. They use some relatively hacky Sketch methods to get the label backgrounds to expand automatically, but they work.

<div class="img img-has-border">
    <div class="img_image">
        <img src="/images/redline-helper-symbols.png" />
    </div>
    <p class="img_caption">An example of the redline symbols in use.</p>
</div>

Let me know if you find them useful!
